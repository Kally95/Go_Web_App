# A Web Application Written in Go

For this web application I have chosen the Go programming language as part of my journey to become more proficient in it.
I have used the MVC architecture with the intent to build a scalable, and tidy web application that allows an individual 
to create galleries in which they can populate with images.
While simple, this web app showcases a idea, and focuses on building strong fundamentals. Focusing on portability, and isolating 
code when best. As well as managing code in different packages to allow for a clean, bug free web application.
